Our project centers around the crucial need to engage the local community of Regina, Saskatchewan,
in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The primary objective is to cultivate a platform that educates,
informs, and motivates residents and potential newcomers about the significant challenges that need attention and action.

By developing a website that not only serves as an educational tool but also as a hub for active involvement, we aim to:

    - Educate the community about pressing issues.
    - Encourage participation and involvement in initiatives that support the SDGs.
    - Provide resources for residents and potential residents evaluating the city.
    - Develop a specific SDG mapping component tailored for Regina to aid officials and professionals
      in making informed decisions and to offer the general public insights into community progress.
