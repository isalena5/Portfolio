I tried the Persona feature. I created a Persona named Paolo that's going to be a viewer, and assigned him to the "Viewers" and "Both" epics.
I also experimented with colours, since I couldn't quite see the white cards because the contrast wasa off on my monitor, but at the end I fixed, so I didn't needed the colours anymore, so I removed them.
